Several years ago I wrote an article about MVVM design pattern in WPF
(http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/139875/WPF-Twitter-Client-with-Model-View-ViewModel-Desig).
Then I continued developing WPF TwitterClient based on MVVM and wrote Anhinga.

As you know twitter api use AOuth autorisation protocol. Thus in order to use Anhinga
you have to register your own twitter application 
on the Twitter portal. After that you will obtain so-called ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret.
You need to enter them in AnhingaTwitterClient properties.
