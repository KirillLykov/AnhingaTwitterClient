Several years ago I wrote an article about MVVM design pattern in WPF
(http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/139875/WPF-Twitter-Client-with-Model-View-ViewModel-Desig).
Then I continued developing WPF TwitterClient based on MVVM and wrote Anhinga.

As you know twitter api use AOuth autorisation protocol. Thus in order to use Anhinga
you have to register your own twitter application 
on the Twitter portal. After that you will obtain so-called ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret.
You need to enter them in AnhingaTwitterClient properties.

It has several dependencies: hammock, newtonsoft.json, tweetsharp.twitter, tweetsharp.
Put the following files in the folder "thirdparty" next to AnhingaTwitterClient folder:
Hammock.dll
Newtonsoft.Json.dll
TweetSharp.Twitter.dll
TweetSharp.Twitter.xml
TweetSharp.dll	
TweetSharp.xml
